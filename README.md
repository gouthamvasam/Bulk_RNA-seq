Here is a general workflow for analyzing bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data starting from FASTQ files:

1. **Quality Control of Raw Reads**: The first step is to check the quality of the raw reads in the FASTQ files. Tools like FastQC can be used for this purpose.

2. **Read Alignment**: The next step is to align the reads to a reference genome. This can be done using tools like STAR or HISAT2.

3. **Quantification**: After alignment, the next step is to quantify the gene expression. This can be done using tools like featureCounts or HTSeq.

4. **Normalization**: The raw count data is then normalized to account for differences in sequencing depth and RNA composition between samples.

5. **Differential Expression Analysis**: Differential expression analysis is performed to identify genes that are differentially expressed between conditions or groups.

6. **Functional Enrichment Analysis**: The list of differentially expressed genes is often used for functional enrichment analysis to identify overrepresented gene sets or pathways.

7. **Visualization**: Finally, the results are visualized using various plots such as MA plots, volcano plots, and heatmaps.
